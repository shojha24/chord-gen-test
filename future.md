# Chord Interpretation & Suggestion Pipeline:
### This system takes an MP3 file and generates rich, intelligent chord charts by combining melody-based generation and audio-based chord detection, all enhanced with LLM refinement.

## 🔧 Components
### 🎤 Vocals → Melody Transcription
Extract vocal melody (monophonic) using a pitch detection model like CREPE or Onsets & Frames.

### 🎹 Melody → Chord Generation
Use a sequence model (e.g. LSTM, Transformer) to generate chord progressions based on vocal melody.

### 🎧 Instrumental/Full Mix → Chord Detection
My model: Run polyphonic chord recognition through my Transformer + HMM pipeline.

### 🧠 LLM Fusion
Merge generated and detected chords using a language model or sequence alignment method.

### Output: High-quality chord charts, optionally with reharmonization suggestions.
