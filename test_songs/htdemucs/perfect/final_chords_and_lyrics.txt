lead. I found a girl beautiful and sweet. I never knew you were the

D#maj Fmin     C#maj  G#maj            D#maj           Fmin          
arms. Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song. When you

G#maj       Fmin                         C#maj

C#maj     D#maj                G#maj         Fmin                    
share her home. I found a love to carry more than just my secrets. To

carry love, to carry children of our own. We are still kids but we're
G#maj                       Fmin                   C#maj
